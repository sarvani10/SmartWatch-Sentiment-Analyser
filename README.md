# SmartWatch Sentiment Analyser ⌚🤖

A Generative AI and Machine Learning based project that analyzes smartwatch
product reviews and predicts sentiment (Positive / Neutral / Negative).
The system uses two different models — a classical Logistic Regression
model and a transformer-based BERT model — for comparison and prediction.

# Problem Statement

Smartwatch platforms receive a huge number of customer reviews every day.
Manually analyzing these reviews to understand user sentiment is difficult
and inefficient. This project automates sentiment analysis using Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

# 🎯 Objectives

To classify smartwatch reviews into sentiment categories

To compare traditional ML and advanced transformer models

To demonstrate the use of Generative AI in text understanding

To build a simple web application for real-time prediction

# 🧠 Models Used
1️⃣ Logistic Regression (Classical ML)

Used with TF-IDF / Count Vectorizer

Fast, lightweight, and interpretable

Serves as a baseline model

# 2️⃣ BERT (Transformer-based GenAI Model)

Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers

Captures deep contextual meaning of text

Loaded using HuggingFace Transformers

Example Model:

nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment

# ✅ Model Note

Pretrained BERT model files are not stored in this repository due to GitHub
file size limitations. The model is automatically downloaded from
HuggingFace at runtime.
The Logistic Regression model is trained using the provided dataset.

⚙️ Tech Stack
